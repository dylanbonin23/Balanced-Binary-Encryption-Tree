# Balanced-Binary-Encryption-Tree

Below is my implementation to create a balanced binary encryption tree for a Data Structures class at Baylor University. The user may input a dictionary which the program uses to create a balanced binarys search tree. Users are also able to remove items from the tree (and the binary tree will stay remain balanced). Attached below is a link to the original project specifications.
